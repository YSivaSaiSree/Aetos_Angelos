Aetos Angelos: A Keen Perception Alert System- Unreachable victims face risks of assault, trafficking, and fatalities. 'Aetos Angelos' employs deep learning and CCTV to aid in emergencies, enhancing survival chances. Addressing persistent societal tragedies through technology.

The rapid evolution of technology has not entirely eradicated incidents that bring grief to society. Personal injury cases such as car accidents and delicate situations like rape, kidnapping, and human trafficking continue to receive extensive attention. While it is inaccurate to claim that unreachability directly causes such heinous crimes, it can certainly contribute to sexual assault, trafficking, and fatalities. Thus, a more nuanced statement is, ”Unreachability can contribute to sexual assault, trafficking, and fatalities.” The occurrence of these tragic events can lead to the loss of life when victims are unable to seek help promptly, and though unpredictable, they underline the importance of responsive assistance systems.

To address this critical issue, we present ”Aetos Angelos,” an innovative deep-learning model employing neural networks to function as an eagle’s eye. Our system utilizes computer vision and hand-landmark recognition techniques to analyze requests made by victims through CCTV cameras. By detecting specific gestures and signs from the victims, Aetos Angelos aims to identify and provide timely assistance to those in need. Aetos Angelos harnesses the extensive network of CCTV cameras installed in various locations, including roads, toll plazas, corporate establishments, malls, bazaars, stores, and residential areas. When individuals find themselves in perilous situations and are unable to reach out for aid through traditional means, they can rely on nearby CCTV cameras to communicate their distress effectively. The primary objective of the Aetos Angelos project is to significantly enhance the chances of saving victims from life-threatening circumstances. By utilizing video surveillance and deep learning technologies, we aim to identify critical patterns indicative of danger promptly. Once the model successfully detects the distress signals from CCTV footage, the system can accurately pinpoint the location of the individual who needs help, enabling swift and targeted assistance.

This highlights that despite technological advancements, societal tragedies like car accidents, sexual assaults, kidnappings, and human trafficking persist. While unreachability isn’t the direct cause, it can contribute to such crimes. The abstract introduces ”Aetos Angelos,” a deep-learning model designed to operate like an eagle’s eye using neural networks, computer vision, and hand-landmark recognition. By analyzing victims’ gestures through CCTV cameras, the system aims to offer timely assistance in critical situations. Aetos Angelos leverages existing CCTV networks across various locations to aid individuals unable to seek help traditionally. The project’s primary objective is to improve victim survival chances by identifying danger cues promptly and accurately through the integration of video surveillance and deep learning technologies.
